We read the data from the various datasets
We then managed to clean and analyze the data by removing null columns and rows.
We then looked at the number of the final rows and columns of each dataset we used, checked the information that the dataset has, and also described the data to have the count, mean and standard deviation of the various datasets.
Through our data analysis, we gained valuable insights into audience preferences, box office trends, and financial metrics, which will inform our recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio.
